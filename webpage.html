           <li> The weather there is always good throughout the whole year, so I would love to visit

                It is one of the best, interesting and cool language to learn in the world. 
                I love watching Tv shows that are in Spanish ,so I would really love to understand it instead of reading the subtiltles always. 
                I am also in love with the spanish accent.
